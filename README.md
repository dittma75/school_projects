# school_projects
Copy of school projects, including my web programming project and databases project.
The web directory contains all work for my web programming class from Spring 2014.
  The SEMESTER_PROJECT directory within the web directory contains a Game Recommendation Interface,
  which uses metacritic.com to suggest games to users.  I wrote most of the JavaScript and all of the
  Perl components.
The db directory contains the user interface for my databases project.  The database portion of the
project was a group project that was half mine, but the user interface was done in Perl and completely
by me.
