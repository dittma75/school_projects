@# Sample Makefile for Web Programming students
#
# by Darren Provine, 14 September 2002
# modified by Kevin Dittmar, 1 March 2014

# These lines should be the only ones you have to change for many
# projects.

DESTDIR = /export/home/dittma75/public_html/web/hw5
TARGETS = SMBC_scraper.cgi three_comic_scraper.cgi webline.css \
	  layout699-.css layout700+.css
SOURCES = SMBC_scraper.cgi three_comic_scraper.cgi webline.css \
	  layout699-.css layout700+.css
# This target is just here to be the top target in the Makefile.
# There's nothing to compile for this one.
all: $(TARGETS)

# You might want to look up mkdir(1) to see about that -p flag.
install: $(TARGETS)
	@@if [ ! -d $(DESTDIR) ] ; then mkdir -p $(DESTDIR); fi
	@@for f in $(TARGETS)                 ; \

		/usr/bin/install -v -t $(DESTDIR) -m 555 $$f ; \
	done

# Note that here we don't blow away the directory, and so we
# be sure and tell the user.  The reason not to delete the
# directory is that it may have other files in it.  Checking
# for, and deleting, any such files will have to be done manually.
# (How could this be improved?)
#
# Note also that the @@ sign keeps the echo lines from being echoed
# before they are run.  (That could be confusing.)  This little
# trick (and many more) can be discovered by consulting make(1).

	cd $(DESTDIR) ; /bin/rm -f $(TARGETS)
