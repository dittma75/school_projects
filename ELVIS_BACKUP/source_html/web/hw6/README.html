<h1>NOTICE!</h1>

<p>
Be sure to look in the corresponding <code>source_html</code>
directory at "sunrise.pl" for a non-CGI version with more
comments.
</p>

<p>
The "sunrise.html" uses only "sunrise_json.cgi" and "sunrise.js"
specifically.
It also links "AjaxFunctions.js" to get the fetch routine.
