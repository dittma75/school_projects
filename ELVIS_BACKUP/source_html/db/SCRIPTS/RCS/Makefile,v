# Note that here we don't blow away the directory, and so we
# be sure and tell the user.  The reason not to delete the
# directory is that it may have other files in it.  Checking
# for, and deleting, any such files will have to be done manually.
# (How could this be improved?)
#
# Note also that the @@ sign keeps the echo lines from being echoed
# before they are run.  (That could be confusing.)  This little
# trick (and many more) can be discovered by consulting make(1).
